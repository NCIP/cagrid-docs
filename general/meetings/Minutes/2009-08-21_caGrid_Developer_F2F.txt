Notes
-----
1) WebSSO
  * No Cross Domain Support (Authn to institutional instead of WebSSO Server)
  * Transfer of user attributes between WebSSO and WebSSO clients are not in standard format (i.e.) presently transferred as Tokenized String
  * [Santhosh] No Single Sign-out support for grid services, just applications
  * [Steve] you can't revoke a proxy ([Ravi]: you wait for it to expire), but you can revoke the cert that signed it and then it wouldn't validate
  Using Shibboleth + CASSHIB
  * http://code.google.com/p/casshib/wiki/CASShibExplained
  * [Scott] open feature requests: https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/WebSVN/filedetails.php?repname=cagrid&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fcagrid%2FMeetings%2F200908_caGrid_Developer_F2F%2FcaGrid_RFEs.xlsx
  * Soulwing (which is an implementation of several CAS clients) CAS Client rolled into WebSSO. [Steve] should be an incubator project.
  * [Steve] thinks that support for Shib is strategically important, especially moving forward with incommon since most incommmon members use Shib.
  * [Steve] thinks in general we should take a more Shib-like approach to Single Sign-on and pursue a prototype, but we'll need to work through the implementation details. 
2) Identifiers
  * Change to new approach (from Handle, which used: dot notation, strings, central registry): standard URI for identifiers themselves. Using HTTP URLs as URIs, central repository is optional
3) CQL2
  Use Cases
  * Associated Object Retrieval
  * Strong Data Types in Query Attributes
  * Aggregations - (Min/Max/Avg done, Group By not implemented)
  * Temporal Queries
  * Complex Attribute Types
  * Returning Attributes from Multiple Objects
  * Returning Subclasses of Domain Objects
  * Querying through Subclasses of Domain Objects
  * Enhanced Fault Mechanism
  * Restrict/Limit Computationally Expensive Queries
4) caGrid 2.0 / Future Work
  * Committed to being specification-based, JAX-WS Implementation, looking at several toolkits: prototyping with CXF now, Metro is still a possibility if blocking CXF issues are encountered. 
  * Information Services (future Globus Index Service) - BIRN is first adopter, JP from Globus is leading. [Joshua] is this just service registration or much more? [Ravi] it can be both. 
  * CTSA/OpenMDR - if projects like OpenMDR succeed, caGrid should support non-caDSR repositories. 
5) KC Feedback
  * Introduce Extension, suggest that KC add documentation, possibly training to educate senior developers how to build extensions
  * Introduce Extensions (i.e. GME) should have some failsafe mode if the service they consume isn't present (lesson learned from caDSR/EVS deprecation)
  * Service Interfaces - [Joshua] ability to build an Operation Provider would be useful [Scott agrees]
  * Ivy support in Introduce-generated services. [Scott] will be solved in 2.0


Parking Lot
-----------
Thu 2) BDA - will discuss during svn refactor
Thu 3) Assertion Repository

Action Items
------------
1) RE: single sign-out taking delegation EPR from client, Security Issue should be documented.
1) [Steve] should join [Scott] and [John]'s weekly call to develop a scope document for next iteration of WebSSO work that we can take to Sichen to allocate [Santhosh's time]. Once we determine that architectural changes should be made to WebSSO, we should socialize those with Patrick and Kalpesh to ensure they will work for CCTS.
