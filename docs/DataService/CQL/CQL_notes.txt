From Patrick:
====================
1) Should only have Target, properties, and associations - not objects 
2) Why does target support multiple groups and objects does not? 
3) Why does objects not support multiple sub-objects? 
4) Group should require the predicate (why called logical operation?) if 3) is supported 
	-scott: agreed; the way groups are done is confusing.. should probably just have named elements ("And" and "Or" instead of Group LogicRelation="OR")
5) Why does CQLQuery have to be named 
	-scott: agreed; should be optional
6) You should support properties underneath Target, as it does not make sense to repeat the object name of the target again unless it is strictly required
	-scott: strongly agreed; target and object should share the same complexType, if not the same element name... worse than not making sense, it is actually incorrect, 
	 because its ambiguous if it is expected to mean just apply the property filters, or if it means a "self association" should be followed
       
Scott:
====================
Some example classes:

 class Person
   String name;
   Address homeAddress;
   Address workAddress;
 
 class Address
   String address;

1) association traversal is ambiguous when there are multiple associations to the same class (with different roles)
For example Consider the query:
Target name=Person
 Object name=Address
 
What does it mean?  Could use the rolename instead.. 
 or have an optional rolename attribute to use as a disambiguator (accompanied with a documented default behavior if its not present, such as it means OR)

2) We should probably support attribute/CDE returns (for example, give me the Gene.symbol instead of all of Gene)
how best to represent?

3) Should we support ranges? (or just handle in delivery options) 

4) There is currently no way to filter a parent and return a child (unless bi-directional associations are present)
For example:
I can say, "give me the Persons for a given address" but I can't say "give me the Address for a given person"

5) When multiple properties are specified its ambiguous if they are "anded" or "ored"

6) Need to decide on allowable property predicate types, and enumerate them... do we want it to be extensible?... probably do as long as core set is always supported
  - heres a first cut (i suggest synonyms...):  Then need to define how they are supposed to work over given data types (for example, what should happen if >= is called on a non-numeric)
    - =, equal
    - !=, not equal
    - <, less than
    - <=, less than or equal 
    - >, greater than
    - >=, greater than or equal
            
7) How can i do a property predicate specifying null as a value? 

8) We may also want to consider allowing property values to be function calls.  If we do, I suggest we adopt a subset of the xpath functions
for String (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#section-String-Functions) and Number (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#section-Number-Functions)
 - would have to consider trade off of utility vs. difficulty to implement

9) not really a "language" issue but... need a common set of Exceptions the query method can throw:
 - heres a first cut:
   -MalformedQueryException: the query doesn't validate to the xsd
   -IllegalQueryException: the query is valid format, but the objects, attributes, or associations used in the query aren't allowed by the exposed object model.
   	 -for example, querying for Gene when the model doesn't have one, or querying for Foo->Bar when there is no such association.
   -QueryProcessingExeception: some failure during query processing... could be subtyped
